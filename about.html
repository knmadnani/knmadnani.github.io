  <h1 style="font-size:25px;">About Me:</h1>
  <p>I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Guwahati. My research interests lie at the intersection of automata theory, formal logic, and computability. I am particularly interested in timed extensions of automata and logic, the formal analysis of infinite-state systems, and the application of theoretical computer science to cyber-physical systemsâ€”such as reactive synthesis and formal verification. I am always eager to collaborate with motivated students and PhD aspirants who are passionate about the foundations of theoretical computer science.</p>
